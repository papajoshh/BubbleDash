# BUBBLE DASH - MONETIZATION STRATEGY

## MONETIZATION OVERVIEW

### Revenue Model
**Hybrid Freemium**: Combining multiple revenue streams for maximum ARPU
- **70% Ad Revenue**: Primary income source
- **25% In-App Purchases**: Premium content and convenience
- **5% Battle Pass**: Recurring revenue and engagement

### Target Metrics
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: $0.05-0.15
- **Conversion Rate (Ads to IAP)**: 2-5%
- **Retention D1/D7/D30**: 40%/15%/5%
- **Session Length**: 3-5 minutes average

## ADVERTISING STRATEGY

### 1. Rewarded Video Ads (Primary Revenue)
**Placement Strategy**:
- **Post-Game Over**: "Watch ad to double your coins?"
- **Upgrade Acceleration**: "Skip 2 hours of idle progress"
- **Power-up Activation**: "Get premium bubble for this run"
- **Daily Bonus**: "Watch ad for bonus daily reward"

**Implementation Guidelines**:
```csharp
// Example integration point
public void OnGameOver()
{
    if (AdManager.Instance.IsRewardedAdReady())
    {
        UIManager.Instance.ShowDoubleCoinsOffer();
    }
}
```

**AdMob Integration IDs**:
- **App ID**: ca-app-pub-8144713847135030
- **Rewarded Video (Double Coins)**: ca-app-pub-8144713847135030/3740665346
- **Interstitial (Game Over)**: ca-app-pub-8144713847135030/8801420338
- **Banner (Menu)**: ca-app-pub-8144713847135030/2116576573

**Frequency Cap**: Maximum 6 rewarded ads per hour
**User Value**: Clear benefit communication before ad

### 2. Interstitial Ads (Secondary Revenue)
**Placement Strategy**:
- **Between Games**: Every 3rd game over (not consecutive)
- **Menu Transitions**: When returning from settings/upgrades
- **Natural Breaks**: After completing daily challenges

**User Experience Rules**:
- Never interrupt active gameplay
- Always at natural pause points
- Respect user's flow state
- Provide clear dismissal options

### 3. Banner Ads (Minimal Revenue, High Fill Rate)
**Placement Strategy**:
- **Upgrade Menus Only**: Bottom of screen, non-intrusive
- **Never During Gameplay**: Maintains game immersion
- **Settings/Options**: Low-engagement screens
