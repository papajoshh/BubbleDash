```

### 2. Time-Pressure Monetization Psychology

#### Android User Behavior Patterns
**Key Insights from 2024 Data**:
- "Pay-at-checkpoint" scenarios show highest conversion
- Time pressure + auxiliary props drive irrational decisions
- Limited opportunity effect particularly strong on mobile
- Goal-setting theory triggers immediate purchases

#### Implementation Strategy
```
Urgency Triggers:
â”œâ”€â”€ Visual Timer Warnings:
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Red countdown at <30 seconds
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Screen pulse effect at <10 seconds
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ "EXTEND TIME" button prominence increases
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Previous best distance shown during countdown
â”œâ”€â”€ Boss Encounter Pressure:
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ "You're so close to beating [Boss Name]!"
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Show boss health remaining during time warning
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Offer boss-specific time extension ($1.49)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ "Don't lose this progress!" messaging
â””â”€â”€ Zone Progression FOMO:
    â”œâ”€â”€ "You need just 200m more for Desert unlock!"
    â”œâ”€â”€ Zone preview during final countdown
    â”œâ”€â”€ Time + zone unlock bundle offer ($2.99)
    â””â”€â”€ Social proof: "1,847 players unlocked Desert today"
```

#### Purchase Timing Optimization
**When to Show Offers** (based on Android user patterns):
1. **3rd death in same zone**: Frustration peak, high conversion
2. **Boss at 20% health + time warning**: Maximum emotional investment
3. **Personal best exceeded by <50m**: "So close" psychology
4. **Daily session 3+**: Player engagement confirmed
5. **Zone unlock threshold reached**: Achievement momentum

### 4. AdMob Integration Strategy

#### Ad Placement Optimization for Android
```
Rewarded Video Ads (Highest Revenue):
â”œâ”€â”€ Double coin rewards: Post-run, high uptake
â”œâ”€â”€ Extra time offers: During countdown, urgent context
â”œâ”€â”€ Boss encounter retry: Emotional peak, willing to watch
â”œâ”€â”€ Upgrade discount: 50% off next purchase after ad
â””â”€â”€ Zone preview: "See Desert zone" before unlock

Interstitial Ads (Frequency Managed):
â”œâ”€â”€ Between runs: Natural break, not disruptive
â”œâ”€â”€ Post boss defeat: Victory celebration extended
â”œâ”€â”€ Zone transitions: Loading time utilization
â”œâ”€â”€ App return: After 4+ hour absence
â””â”€â”€ Settings/upgrade menu: Low engagement moments

Banner Ads (Minimal Intrusion):
â”œâ”€â”€ Main menu only: Not during gameplay
â”œâ”€â”€ Upgrade shop: During browsing, not purchasing
â”œâ”€â”€ Statistics screen: Information context
â””â”€â”€ Disabled during VIP subscription
```

#### Ad Revenue Optimization
**AdMob Best Practices for Roguelite**:
- Mediation with multiple ad networks (Facebook, Unity, AppLovin)
- Frequency capping: Max 3 interstitials per session
- Rewarded video: Unlimited, player-initiated only
- ECPM targets: $4-6 for rewarded, $2-3 for interstitial
- Geographic optimization: Higher rates for US/EU users
