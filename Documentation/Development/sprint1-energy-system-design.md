# ðŸ”‹ SPRINT 1 REVISADO - ENERGY SYSTEM DESIGN

## ðŸ“‹ CONTEXTO DEL CAMBIO

### Problema Identificado con Timer System:
- Timer system implementado pero **no resuelve el core engagement problem**
- Players se aburren en 10 segundos porque es "esperar que se acabe el tiempo"
- Falta de **stakes inmediatos** en cada acciÃ³n

### Nueva DirecciÃ³n - Energy System:
**Reemplazar timer por energy que se drena constantemente**
- Cada bubble hit = supervivencia
- Mini-objetivos = energy boosts crÃ­ticos
- Game over cuando energy = 0

---

## ðŸŽ¯ DESIGN CORE DEL ENERGY SYSTEM

### MecÃ¡nica Base:
```
STARTING ENERGY: 10 points
ENERGY DRAIN RATE: 1 point/second (ajustable)
ENERGY GAIN:
â”œâ”€â”€ Bubble Hit: +1 energy
â”œâ”€â”€ Combo Bonus: +0.5 per combo level (5 combo = +2.5 total)
â”œâ”€â”€ Mini-Objective Complete: +3 energy
â””â”€â”€ Coin Collection: +0.5 energy

GAME OVER: Energy reaches 0
```

### Difficulty Curve (Learning):
```
FIRST 3 RUNS:
â”œâ”€â”€ Starting Energy: 15
â”œâ”€â”€ Drain Rate: 0.5/second
â””â”€â”€ Bubble Hit: +1.5 energy

NORMAL DIFFICULTY:
â”œâ”€â”€ Starting Energy: 10  
â”œâ”€â”€ Drain Rate: 1/second
â””â”€â”€ Bubble Hit: +1 energy

HARD MODE (unlock later):
â”œâ”€â”€ Starting Energy: 8
â”œâ”€â”€ Drain Rate: 1.5/second  
â””â”€â”€ Bubble Hit: +0.8 energy
```

---

## ðŸŽ® MINI-OBJETIVOS SYSTEM

### Objetivo Types (aparecen cada 15-20 segundos):
```
PRECISION OBJECTIVES:
â”œâ”€â”€ "Hit 3 red bubbles" (+3 energy)
â”œâ”€â”€ "Get 5 consecutive hits" (+3 energy)
â”œâ”€â”€ "No miss for 15 seconds" (+4 energy)
â””â”€â”€ "Hit bubbles through gap" (+2 energy)

COLLECTION OBJECTIVES:  
â”œâ”€â”€ "Collect 3 coins" (+3 energy)
â”œâ”€â”€ "Hit one of each color" (+4 energy)
â”œâ”€â”€ "Pop 10 bubbles in 20s" (+3 energy)
â””â”€â”€ "Collect while at max speed" (+4 energy)

MOMENTUM OBJECTIVES:
â”œâ”€â”€ "Reach max momentum" (+2 energy)
â”œâ”€â”€ "Maintain speed for 10s" (+3 energy)
â”œâ”€â”€ "Get 8+ combo" (+4 energy)
â””â”€â”€ "Hit 15 bubbles without missing" (+5 energy)
```

### Objective Selection Logic:
```csharp
// Weighted based on current player state
if (momentum < 5) â†’ More momentum objectives
if (accuracy < 70%) â†’ More precision objectives  
if (coins_collected < 3) â†’ More collection objectives
Random selection from weighted pool every 15-20 seconds
```

## ðŸŒŠ WAVE/MILESTONE SYSTEM

### Distance-Based Waves:
```
WAVE 1 (0-200m): "LEARNING ZONE"
â”œâ”€â”€ Easy objectives (3 bubble hits, collect 2 coins)
â”œâ”€â”€ Normal bubble patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ Objective frequency: Every 20 seconds
â””â”€â”€ Energy drain: -1/second

WAVE 2 (200-400m): "SPEED CHALLENGE"  
â”œâ”€â”€ Momentum-focused objectives
â”œâ”€â”€ Faster bubble movements
â”œâ”€â”€ Objective frequency: Every 18 seconds
â””â”€â”€ Energy drain: -1/second

WAVE 3 (400-600m): "PRECISION ZONE"
â”œâ”€â”€ Accuracy-focused objectives  
â”œâ”€â”€ Smaller bubbles, tighter patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ Objective frequency: Every 15 seconds
â””â”€â”€ Energy drain: -1.2/second

WAVE 4 (600-800m): "COIN RUSH"
â”œâ”€â”€ Collection-focused objectives
â”œâ”€â”€ More coin bubbles spawn
â”œâ”€â”€ Objective frequency: Every 15 seconds  
â””â”€â”€ Energy drain: -1.2/second

WAVE 5 (800m+): "CHAOS MODE"
â”œâ”€â”€ Mixed objectives, higher difficulty
â”œâ”€â”€ All bubble types, complex patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ Objective frequency: Every 12 seconds
â””â”€â”€ Energy drain: -1.5/second
```

### Wave Transition Effects:
```
VISUAL: Screen flash + "WAVE X" text display
AUDIO: Achievement sound + music intensity increase
UI: Wave indicator + next milestone distance
ENERGY: +2 energy bonus for reaching new wave
```

## ðŸ”§ ENERGY BUFFERS & SAFETY SYSTEMS

### Energy Shield System:
```
SHIELD ACTIVATION:
â”œâ”€â”€ Perfect objective completion (no misses) = 3s shield
â”œâ”€â”€ 10+ combo achievement = 2s shield  
â”œâ”€â”€ Max momentum reached = 1s shield
â””â”€â”€ Coin collection streak = 1s shield

SHIELD EFFECT:
â”œâ”€â”€ Energy drain paused during shield
â”œâ”€â”€ Visual indicator (blue glow around energy bar)
â”œâ”€â”€ Audio cue (protective sound)
â””â”€â”€ Can stack up to 5 seconds maximum
```

### Safe Zones (Wave Transitions):
```
BETWEEN WAVES (every 200m):
â”œâ”€â”€ 3 seconds of no energy drain
â”œâ”€â”€ "SAFE ZONE" text indicator
â”œâ”€â”€ Moment to see progress/plan ahead
â”œâ”€â”€ Visual breathing room effect
â””â”€â”€ Automatic +1 energy bonus
```

## ðŸŽ¯ INTEGRATION CON SISTEMAS EXISTENTES

### Momentum System:
```
UNCHANGED: Speed/combo mechanics work the same
NEW: High momentum gives energy efficiency bonus
â”œâ”€â”€ 5+ momentum: Energy hits give +1.2 instead of +1
â”œâ”€â”€ 10+ momentum: Energy hits give +1.5 instead of +1  
â”œâ”€â”€ Max momentum: Energy drain reduced to 0.8/second
â””â”€â”€ Momentum loss on miss: No energy penalty (just loss of bonus)
```

### Upgrade System:
```
NEW UPGRADE CATEGORIES:

ENERGY MASTERY:
â”œâ”€â”€ "Extra Battery": +2 starting energy
â”œâ”€â”€ "Efficient Shooting": +0.2 energy per hit  
â”œâ”€â”€ "Slow Drain": -0.2 energy drain rate
â””â”€â”€ "Shield Master": +1 second shield duration

OBJECTIVE MASTERY:
â”œâ”€â”€ "Easy Targets": Objectives 20% easier
â”œâ”€â”€ "Bonus Hunter": +1 energy from objectives
â”œâ”€â”€ "Quick Goals": Objectives appear 10% more often
â””â”€â”€ "Perfect Timing": Shield on every objective complete
```

### Roguelite Integration:
```
PRE-RUN CHOICES (future sprint):
â”œâ”€â”€ "High Risk": Start with 6 energy, +2 per hit
â”œâ”€â”€ "Safe Start": Start with 15 energy, normal rates
â”œâ”€â”€ "Speed Run": Double drain, double rewards
â””â”€â”€ "Practice Mode": Half drain rate (learning)
```

## ðŸ“Š BALANCING PARAMETERS

### Key Variables to Monitor:
```csharp
public class EnergyBalanceConfig
{
    [Header("Base Settings")]
    public float startingEnergy = 10f;
    public float energyDrainRate = 1f; // per second
    public float energyPerHit = 1f;
    public float energyPerObjective = 3f;
    
    [Header("Difficulty Scaling")]
    public float drainRateIncreasePerWave = 0.2f;
    public float maxDrainRate = 2f;
    
    [Header("Safety Systems")]
    public float shieldDurationPerObjective = 3f;
    public float safeZoneDuration = 3f;
    public int maxShieldStackSeconds = 5;
    
    [Header("Learning Curve")]
    public float beginnerEnergyBonus = 5f; // First 3 runs
    public float beginnerDrainReduction = 0.5f;
    public int beginnerRunsCount = 3;
}
```

### Success Metrics:
```
TARGET METRICS:
â”œâ”€â”€ Average run duration: 2-4 minutes (vs current 30s-1min)
â”œâ”€â”€ Player engagement: No "dead time" feeling
â”œâ”€â”€ Learning curve: 80% complete first objective
â”œâ”€â”€ Retention: Players want "one more try" immediately
â””â”€â”€ Difficulty: 70% of players reach Wave 3 within 5 attempts
```

## ðŸš¨ POTENTIAL RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Risk 1: Too Stressful
```
INDICATORS: Players quit after 1-2 tries, negative feedback
MITIGATION: Reduce drain rate, increase starting energy
MONITORING: Track attempt count vs completion rate
```

### Risk 2: Too Easy  
```
INDICATORS: Players easily reach 5+ minutes, no tension
MITIGATION: Increase drain rate progressively
MONITORING: Track average run duration
```

### Risk 3: Objective Frustration
```
INDICATORS: Players ignore objectives, only focus on hits
MITIGATION: Make objectives more achievable, increase energy bonus
MONITORING: Track objective completion rate
```

### Risk 4: Learning Curve Too Steep
```
INDICATORS: New players die in <30 seconds consistently
MITIGATION: Extended tutorial mode, guided first run
MONITORING: Track new player first-run completion rate
```
