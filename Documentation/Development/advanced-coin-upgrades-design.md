## 🎮 GAMEPLAY IMPACT ANALYSIS

### **Strategic Decision Making:**
```
WITHOUT UPGRADES:
Player focuses → Bubble patterns + Movement
Coins are → Passive side benefit

WITH UPGRADES:
Player considers → "Use rare red bubble on coin cluster?"
Decision factors → Coin value vs bubble scarcity vs position
New strategy layer → Coin cluster prioritization
```

### **Risk/Reward Balance:**
```
🎯 Bubble Breaker Decisions:
├── High Value: Large coin cluster visible
├── Medium Risk: Uses limited bubble type
├── Positioning: Need clear shot angle
└── Timing: Don't miss during pressure moments
```

### **Progression Incentive:**
```
BOSS DEFEAT REWARDS:
├── Boss 1: Unlocks active coin mechanics
├── Boss 2: Unlocks premium convenience 
├── Endgame: Super expensive quality-of-life
└── Motivation: "I need to beat bosses for coin upgrades!"
```

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Coin Bubble Types:**
```csharp
public enum CoinCollectionType 
{
    Magnetic,     // Current system
    Shootable,    // Requires bubble impact
    AutoCollect   // Touch to collect
}
```

### **Upgrade Effects Integration:**
```csharp
// In Coin.cs
public bool canBeShot = false;          // Bubble Breaker upgrade
public int coinMultiplier = 1;          // Coin Multiplier upgrade  
public bool autoCollectEnabled = false; // Auto Collector upgrade
public bool burstEnabled = false;       // Coin Burst upgrade
```

### **Bubble Impact Detection:**
```csharp
// In Bubble.cs - when bubble hits coin
void OnBubbleCollision(Coin coinBubble)
{
    if (PlayerPrefs.GetInt("BubbleBreakerUnlocked") == 1)
    {
        coinBubble.CollectByImpact(this.bubbleType);
    }
}
```

## ❓ OPEN QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

1. **Bubble Type Specificity**: 
   - Should only specific bubble colors break coins?
   - Or any bubble type? (Simpler, more flexible)

2. **Boss Unlock UI**:
   - Show locked upgrades grayed out?
   - Or hide completely until unlocked?

3. **Auto Collector Balance**:
   - Should it disable magnetic collection?
   - Or work in addition to it?

4. **Visual Polish Priority**:
   - Particle effects for coin collection?
   - Special animations for multiplied coins?

## 🎯 EXPECTED PLAYER REACTIONS

### **Positive Engagement:**
```
💭 "I need to beat Boss 1 to unlock coin shooting!"
💭 "Should I use my red bubble on that coin cluster?"
💭 "Auto collector costs 2000... worth saving for?"
💭 "My coin strategy is completely different now!"
```

### **Strategic Depth:**
```
🧠 Build Planning: "Coin-focused vs speed-focused run?"
🧠 Risk Assessment: "Worth the shot for those 4 coins?"
🧠 Resource Management: "Save bullets or grab coins?"
🧠 Progression Goals: "Need 5 more runs for Auto Collector"
```
